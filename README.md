# stepinto-aws-tools

This packages includes a number of resources which are useful for developing and deploying
applications using Amazon Web Services resources and infrastructure.  It is intended for use
with applications under the Stepinto.io umbrella, and follows patterns and conventions developed
by Adam Fitzpatrick.

Specifically, the package hosts a selection of L3 AWS CDK constructs, utilities for consistent
tagging and naming of AWS resources, and simplified clients to access a number of AWS resources.
